# Car-Rental-System-OOP

## Overview
This project serves as a demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, focusing on building a command-line interface for a car rental business simulation.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Cornell Car Rental Dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kushleshkumar/cornell-car-rental-dataset). This dataset provides valuable information for simulating various aspects of a car rental system.

## Features
*Object-Oriented Design:* The project extensively employs OOP principles to model different entities within the car rental system, such as cars, customers, rentals, etc.

*Command-Line Interface:* Users interact with the system via a command-line interface, which allows them to perform actions like renting a car, returning a car, checking available cars, etc.

*Data Handling:* The project demonstrates effective techniques for handling and managing data, including reading data from external sources (the Cornell Car Rental Dataset) and manipulating it as required.

##  Usage
To run the program:

- Clone this repository to your local machine;
- Install the required dependencies;
- Ensure you have Python installed;
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Run the run.py using Python.
